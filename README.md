Scripts for ToonBoom Harmony

These scripts are ones that I use frequently when working with ToonBoom Harmony.

They are released under GPL V3.

For installation, please follow the instructions on Harmony's website:
https://docs.toonboom.com/help/harmony-16/premium/scripting/import-script.html

I hope you find them useful!
